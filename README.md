## 🔑 API Key Notice
This project uses the TMDB API key directly in client-side code.  
This is intentional for demonstration purposes.  
In production, the key should be managed securely on the server side.

---

## 🎯 Focus
This project emphasizes:
- 🧼 Clean DOM manipulation  
- 🔄 Async API handling  
- 🎨 UI feedback based on data  
- 🧩 Readable and maintainable structure  

---

## 🧠 Architecture Flow
The application follows a simple client-side flow:  
UI events trigger API requests to the TMDB service, fetched data is processed asynchronously, and the DOM is dynamically updated based on the response.  
The structure separates data fetching, UI rendering, and user interaction to keep the code readable, scalable, and easy to maintain.
